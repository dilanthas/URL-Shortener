# Technologies used
1. Java
2. Spring boot
3. Redis
4. Docker


#Further Improvements
1. In the long run its better to have a separate service to handle the unique ids. Currently its generated by redis increment id feature.This can be handled using a configration management service like zookeeper.
2. Implement a separate cache for data reads. This application will have more data reads than writes. To have better performance we can have a separate in memory cache to handle that load rather than using the main database.
